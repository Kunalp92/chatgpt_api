# Interview App with OpenAI GPT Integration

This is an Android-based Interview App built using Java in Android Studio. The app asks the user a series of random interview questions, accepts text answers, and sends those answers to the OpenAI GPT model to get feedback on the quality of the responses. The app is designed for mock interview practice and can handle multiple questions in a session.

## Features
- Asks the user 5 random interview questions.
- Accepts text answers from the user.
- Sends the answers to the OpenAI GPT API for analysis.
- Displays feedback about the quality of each answer.
- Once all 5 questions are answered, the interview session ends.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Java (Android Development)
- OpenAI API Key (You need an OpenAI account to generate an API key)

### 2. Clone the Repository
To clone the project to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interview-app.git
```

### 3. Open in Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Click on "File" > "Open" and select the cloned project folder.
3. Wait for the Gradle build to finish.

### 4. Obtain OpenAI API Key
1. Sign up or log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Go to the API section and generate an API key.
3. Copy the API key.

### 5. Add API Key to the App
In the `MainActivity.java` file, locate the following line:
```java
private static final String API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY";
```
Replace `"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"` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

## Run the App
1. Connect your Android device or set up an emulator in Android Studio.
2. Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and install the app on your device/emulator.
3. Start answering the questions and see the feedback from GPT.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Network Error Toast
If you encounter an error showing a toast message with "Network error, please try again!", follow these steps:
1. **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure that the device/emulator has internet access.
2. **API Key:** Make sure you've correctly added your OpenAI API key in the `MainActivity.java` file.
3. **LogCat Debugging:** Use Android Studio's LogCat to view detailed error logs. Look for networking or API-related issues.

### Error: OpenAI API Failure
If the OpenAI API call fails, check the following:
1. **Rate Limits:** OpenAI has usage limits. Ensure you are not exceeding the API rate limits.
2. **API Key Validity:** Double-check if your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
